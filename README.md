# Reducing Zoom Backlighting
## Computer Vision Fall 2021

The goal of this project is to mitigate the negative effects of backlighting on videos or photos of people. 

`Zoom_Backlight_Experiment.ipynb` contains the code I used to develop my pipeline and experiment with different methods. This is where the bulk of the code is.

`VisionDataAnalysis.ipynb` contains the code I used to evaluate my models using the data from my survey.

`CropPhotos.ipynb` contains utilities to crop photos so that they were all the same size.

`live-video` is a folder with code used to evaluate live video. I did not end up using this in the final version of the project, since I chose to focus on images.
